# BINARIA

## A resource-managing game made by [Leo Rudberg](https://github.com/LOZORD) in 2013-14

### To play:

Either `git clone` the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/LOZORD/binaria), or download the zip file.

If you download the zip file, feel free to unzip it.

Then, open up a terminal window (assuming Unix system) and run `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` until you get
to the file containing the game (a bunch of `.rb` files).

Next, run `make sure` to see if you've made it to the directory.

Once you're in the game directory, run `make bundle`. This will download some tools I used in making the game.
If you get a complaint about permissions or writing, run `sudo make bundle`. `sudo` let's your computer know who's boss.

Next, run `make check` to make sure you have everything you need to play the game. If that succeeds, you're read.

The final step is to run `make` (`make all` also works).

___Enjoy!___
